This is my workspace for building ML concepts from scratch.

ML is super hot right now and very few people actually know how things work. So I'm building everything from first principles. So far, I've built:

1. Decoder only transformer block
2. simple inference engine w/ batch processing
3. BytePair Encoder/Decoder
